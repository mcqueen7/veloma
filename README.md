# Veloma - Virtual Theremin

Velocity, Volume, and Motion

A gesture-controlled musical instrument inspired by the Theremin, built with computer vision and SCAMP for audio synthesis.

## Overview

Veloma uses your webcam to track hand movements and translates them into musical expression:

- **Hand position (Y-axis)**: Controls pitch - move your hand up for higher notes, down for lower notes
- **Hand position (X-axis)**: Controls volume - move your hand left/right to adjust volume
- **Two hands**: Advanced control with one hand for pitch and distance between hands for volume
